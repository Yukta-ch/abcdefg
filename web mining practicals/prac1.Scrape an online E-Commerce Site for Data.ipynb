      "Top positive reviewAll positive reviewsâ€º Bhagwant Patil4.0 out of 5 starsGreat iPhone but overpriced.Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 2 April 2021I'm writing this review after 1 month of use.Look & feel- premium & satisfyingDisplay- It has OLED display but not much different than previous LCD display of iPhone XR. BOTH ARE STUNNING & elegant. In fact I liked LCD display more.Battery life- Excellent. With heavy use of 2+ hrs of Instagram scrolling 1+ hr of YouTube streaming 2+ hrs of listening to music, battery lasts for a whole day. With moderate use for only calling, texting & some surfing it lasts for 1 & 1/2 day.Camera- amazing shots in daylight. Night mode is great addition. Portrait mode is great in daytime but it doesn't have night mode. Photos loose details after zooming in. Upto 2x zoom is good, after that it's useless.Ultrawide feature is good but didn't used it much. Front camera is okay, could have been better.Performance- Ultrafast & smooth. It had heated a lot when moving data from older phone. Heats when used during charging. Fast charger does its job well.Conclusion- This is a great iPhone but is not a value for money. Overpriced! We can say this about every iPhone. If you are spending this much amount of money you should go for iPhone 12 128GB for about same price but with only 2 snappers which are more than enough. Third snapper in 11 pro doesn't make a difference.If you are waiting for iPhone 13 to be launched & thinking of buying 12 after price drop, then consider iPhone 11 for now - 2 snappers, LCD display(not much different), bigger than pro, value for money.Thanks for reading.\n",
